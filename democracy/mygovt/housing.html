	<br><b>Housing</b><br><br>
To make sure that your city, town or county grows in the best way possible, people called city planners draw up a master plan. In this way, residential homes are built in one area, businesses and industries in another area. Planners also think about what services, such as schools, churches and parks will be needed in your community.
 <br><br>
Your local, state and federal government also create building codes that make sure each home is safe and energy efficient.  Many of these requirements are established by the government agency known as the Department of Housing and Urban Development or HUD. This office also makes sure all public buildings are designed to be handicap-accessible so that people in wheelchairs or who have other disabilities can use all new buildings.
