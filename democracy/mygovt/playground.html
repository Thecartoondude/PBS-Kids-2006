	<br><b>Playground</b><br><br>
How would you like to grow up and get a job playing on the playground?  People working for the National Program For Playground Safety (NPPS) did just that!  They spent two years visiting playgrounds all across America and grading how safe they were.  Guess what&#151;America's playgrounds get only a C!
<br><br>
How safe is your playground?  Print out this quick checklist and take it with you the next time you visit.  Then, think about who you could contact about your result&#151;your school principal, your town's mayor or others&#151;and how you could help make it a safer place.

Checklist:
<ul>
<li>The ground in my playground is covered in wood mulch, sand, or gravel rather than concrete, dirt or grass. (If kids fall, they're less likely to get hurt if they land on mulch, sand, or gravel.)</li>
<li>There are signs posted at my playground asking adults to watch young children. (Adults can help warn kids when they're using playground equipment in a dangerous way, such as going down the slide headfirst.  With adults paying attention at playgrounds, 40 percent of playground injuries can be avoided!)</li>
<li>There are separate play areas for kids between the ages of two to five and ages five to twelve.  (Very young kids may not be big enough or able to understand how to use the same playground equipment that older kids do, and might get hurt.)</li>
<li>Swings in my playground have soft seats, not wood or metal seats.  (If you are accidentally hit by a swing, it will cause less harm this way.)</li>
<li>There are no missing steps or railings on playground equipment that is raised off the ground, such as slides or forts.</li>
